# Contact Form 7 Storage plugin for WordPress

**Contact Form 7 Storage plugin stores copies of all Contact Form 7 submissions (including attachments) in your WordPress dashboard.** All form entries and leads will be stored safely even if your e-mail goes down or e-mail messages go missing or get deleted.

This plugin is developed and maintained by Kaspars Dambis who is a WordPress core contributor and professional WordPress consultant since 2007.


## Features

**All form submissions are stored in the WordPress backend in addition to being sent via e-mail.** E-mail delivery is never 100% reliable and having a backup of all contact entries will ensure you never miss a lead or inquiry.

- Subject line of the e-mail that was sent to the contact form recipient
- All attachments uploaded to the contact form
- Page URL of where the contact form was submitted (referer).
- Browser and device information of the submission.
- Link to the setup page of the contact form that was used for submission.
